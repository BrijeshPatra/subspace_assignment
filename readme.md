# Fintech Backend

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 14.x)
- MongoDB (running locally or remote)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fintech-project.git
   cd fintech-project/backend

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
3. Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following
   content:
   ```sh
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/fintechDB
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

4. Start the server
   ```sh
   npm start

   
### 3. API Documentation

**Using Postman**:

1. **Create a Postman Collection**:
   - Open Postman and create a new collection.
   - Add requests for each endpoint (register, login, profile, deposit, withdraw).
   - Save the collection and export it as a `.json` file.

2. **Include Documentation**:
   - Provide details for each request, including:
     - Endpoint
     - Method (GET, POST, etc.)
     - Request headers and body
     - Response structure and example responses

**Example Postman Documentation**:
```markdown

# Design Decisions and Assumptions

## Design Decisions

1. **Database**: MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility with schema design and scalability.
2. **Authentication**: JWT was selected for its ease of use and stateless nature, making it suitable for API authentication.
3. **Frontend**: A simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend was used for ease of development and quick testing.

## Assumptions

1. **Security**: It is assumed that the JWT secret is kept secure and not exposed in the source code.
2. **Deployment**: The deployment environment will properly handle environment variables for sensitive data.
3. **User Experience**: The frontend is designed to be simple, assuming basic user requirements without complex features.

## Future Improvements

- Implement user input validation on both frontend and backend.
- Add more comprehensive error handling and logging.
- Enhance the frontend with additional features and improved user experience.
